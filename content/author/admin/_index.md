I'm an independent research fellow at the University of Manchester where I work mainly on the psychology of decision-making. I am currently investigating how decision-making is affected by autism and other neurodevelopmental conditions. In particular I am interested in applying [computational rationality](/#posts) to this area. 

Decision-making research can have very practical applications, such has how to convey information to people in a way they can make best use of it. I am a visiting researcher at the [Winton Centre for Risk & Evidence Communication]() at the University of Cambridge where I collaborate on projects to help improve the communication of risk, whether it's in deciding between cancer treatments or how statistics are reported in the media.
